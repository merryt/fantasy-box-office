# Fantasy Box Office

todo:

- build movie details page
- build draft mechanic (perhaps this will require some realtime stuff)
- get box office data
- build browser for upcoming movers (list page?)
- ability to associate users to movies within the context of a league
- figure out rules I would like for game
